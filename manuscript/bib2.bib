  abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture approach to model individual differences in cognition. Mixture components can be used to identify latent groups of subjects who use different cognitive processes, while hierarchical distributions can be used to capture more minor variation within each group. We apply Bayesian hierarchical mixture methods in two illustrative applications involving category learning. One focuses on a problem that is typically conceived of as a problem of parameter estimation, while the other focuses on a problem that is traditionally tackled from a model selection perspective. Using both previously published and newly collected data, we demonstrate the flexibility and wide applicability of the hierarchical mixture approach to modeling individual differences. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {To investigate the structure of individual differences in performance on behavioral tasks, Haaf and Rouder (2017) developed a class of hierarchical Bayesian mixed models with varying levels of constraint on the individual effects. The models are then compared via Bayes factors, telling us which model best predicts the observed data. One common criticism of their method is that the observed data are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. However, for most cognitive tasks, the primary measure of performance is a response time, the distribution of which is well known not to be normal. In this paper, I investigate the assumption of normality for two datasets in numerical cognition. Specifically, I show that using a shifted lognormal model for the response times does not change the overall pattern of inference. Further, since the model-estimated effects are now on a logarithmic scale, the interpretation of the modeling becomes more difficult, particularly because the estimated effect is now multiplicative rather than additive. As a result, I recommend that even though response times are not normally distributed in general, the simplification afforded by the Haaf and Rouder's approach provides a pragmatic approach to modeling individual differences in behavioral tasks.},

For example, in a Stroop task we expect responses to \-incongruent items to be slower than those to congruent ones, and this d\- irection implies one \-theoretical explanation. Yet, if congruent words are slowed down relative to incongruent words we would have a completely different theoretical explanation. We ask a `does \-everybody' \-question, such as, `does every individual show a Stroop effect in the same direction?' Or, `does every individual respond faster to loud tones than soft tones?' If all individuals truly have effects in the same direction that implicate a common theory, we term the \-differences among them as \-quantitative individual differences. Conversely, if all individuals truly have effects in different directions that implicate different theories, we term the differences among them as \-qualitative individual differences. Here, we provide a users guide to the question of whether i\-ndividual d\- ifferences are qualitative or quantitative. We discuss theoretical issues, m\- ethodological advances, new software for assessment, and, most importantly, how the \-question impacts theory development in cognitive science. Our hope is that this mode of analysis is a productive tool in researchers' toolkits.},

Whenever researchers formulate inequality constrained hypotheses, however, they must rely on sampling-based methods that are relatively inefficient and computationally expensive. To address this problem we developed a bridge sampling routine that allows an efficient evaluation of multinomial inequality constraints. An empirical application showcases that bridge sampling outperforms current Bayesian methods, especially when relatively little posterior mass falls in the restricted parameter space. The method is extended to mixtures between equality and inequality constrained hypotheses.},

In this paper, we document               qualitative               individual differences in the effect. While the overwhelming majority of participants display the usual               positive               truth effect, a minority are the opposite---they reliably discount the validity of repeated statements, what we refer to as               negative               truth effect. We examine eight truth-effect data sets where individual-level data are curated. These sets are composed of 1105 individuals performing 38,904 judgments. Through Bayes factor model comparison, we show that reliable negative truth effects occur in five of the eight data sets. The negative truth effect is informative because it seems unreasonable that the mechanisms mediating the positive truth effect are the same that lead to a discounting of repeated statements' validity. Moreover, the presence of qualitative differences motivates a different type of analysis of individual differences based on ordinal (i.e., Which sign does the effect have?) rather than metric measures. To our knowledge, this paper reports the first such reliable qualitative differences in a cognitive task.},

  abstract = {Systems factorial technology (Townsend and Nozawa, 1995) is a leading methodology for assessing the processing of multiple-feature items. By using certain experimental designs and analyses, researchers can assess whether features are processed in serial, in parallel, or coactively. Current practice is to categorize each individual as displaying one of these three architectures. We argue this approach implicitly assumes heterogeneity of processing strategies across participants. A more scientifically meaningful approach may be to first ask whether all people are serial or parallel or coactive before assuming heterogeneity. We develop a series of Bayesian hierarchical models that captures both situations where everyone follows a common architecture and, alternatively, where there is heterogeneity in architecture. These models use g-prior structures that make computation of Bayes factors convenient. We report an application to investigate Miller's (1956) notion of chunking. We asked participants to compare objects that are composed of separable features simultaneously, a perception task, and sequentially, a memory task. We assessed whether processing changed across the perception and memory tasks with the notion that participants might have to chunk features to store them, and that this chunking might make processing more efficient. The answer is ``no.'' We find a serial architecture for processing for highly separable features (size of circle and the orientation of its diameter) in both the perception and memory tasks. We also find parallel processing for less separable features (first and second digits in a two-digit number) in both perception and memory tasks. Taken together, while processing may depend on the separability of features, it does not vary across perception and memory. As importantly, we find that all people had the same processing strategy; that is models that stated no heterogeneity outperformed those with heterogeneity. This result indicates that architecture may be universal in this setting and not under strategic control.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between symbolic numerical abilities and individual differences in mathematical competencies has become a central research endeavor in the last years. Evidence on this foundational relationship is often based on two behavioral signatures of numerical magnitude and numerical order processing: the canonical and the reverse distance effect. The former indicates faster reaction times for the comparison of numerals that are far in distance (e.g., 2 8) compared to numerals that are close in distance (e.g., 2 3). The latter indicates faster reaction times for the ordinal judgment of numerals (i.e., are numerals in ascending/descending order) that are close in distance (e.g., 2 3 4) compared to numerals that are far in distance (e.g., 2 4 6). While a substantial body of literature has reported consistent associations between the canonical distance effect and arithmetic abilities, rather inconsistent findings have been found for the reverse distance effect. Here, we tested the hypothesis that estimates of the reverse distance effect show qualitative differences (i.e., not all participants show a reverse distance effect in the expected direction) rather than quantitative differences (i.e., all individuals show a reverse distance effect, but to a different degree), and that inconsistent findings might be a consequence of this variation. We analyzed data from 397 adults who performed a computerized numerical comparison task, a computerized numerical order verification task (i.e., are three numerals presented in order or not), a paper pencil test of arithmetic fluency, as well as a standardized test to assess more complex forms of mathematical competencies. We found discriminatory evidence for the two distance effects. While estimates of the canonical distance effect showed quantitative differences, estimates of the reverse distance effect showed qualitative differences. Comparisons between individuals who demonstrated an effect and individuals who demonstrated no reverse distance effect confirmed a significant moderation on the correlation with mathematical abilities. Significantly larger effects were found in the group who showed an effect. These findings confirm that estimates of the reverse distance effect are subject to qualitative differences and that we need to better characterize the underlying mechanisms/ strategies that might lead to these qualitative differences.},
